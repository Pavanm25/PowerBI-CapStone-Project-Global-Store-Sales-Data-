After the Datasets are Loaded into the PowerBI
A new Table should be Created and named as Important Measures Table.
Some of the new measures must be added into the Important Measures Table.
1. Total Sales = SUM(Orders[Quantity]) * SUM(Orders[Unit Price])
2. Profit = SUM(Orders[Profit])
3. Profit Ratio = DIVIDE([Profit],[Total Sales],0)
4. Report as of Date = "Report As of Date:" & MAX(Orders[Order Date])

The Total Sales measure must be Updated to:
Total Sales = SUMX(Orders, Orders[Unit Price] * Orders[Quantity])
